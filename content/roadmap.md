Starting today platforms are required to abide by the
[Online Safety Act (Cth) 2024] - while only some large platforms have been
designated as explicit targets of the eSafety Commission, all social media
websites/apps that fall under the Act's criteria must implement Age Assurance
must abide by the Act.

This is **not** about my opinion of the Act, that's pretty clearly stated in
the link above. This is instead about how updates to tools such as the
[Top Cut Explorer] will be communicated in the absence of social media because
I'm not going to trust corporations with this kind of data, a mistake that
I've had [to make][optus_hack] [twice][medibank_hack] and don't intend to do
voluntarily.

If there are any particularly neat updates to a project of mine you can expect
they'll be listed on this blog. Similarly, if there are any new projects you can
expect them to be announced here. You can follow the RSS feed if any of you
still use feed readers in 2025.

I won't be doing the weekly posts I did on BlueSky announcing tournaments being
put up on the [Top Cut Explorer], you can check back once they're over I'll
generally try to have them up by Tuesday AEDT, or if Twitter doesn't want my
face scan I'll keep posting there.

Feel free to post them around I'm just not going to cop a face scan as a
precondition of Posting - this isn't a call to boycott this is a personal
decision that I'm making for myself.

Hey maybe if The Website Formerly Known As Twitter kicks me off their platform
I can finally focus on making my websites work amirite gamers.

Cheers,

Stuart Rutherford
